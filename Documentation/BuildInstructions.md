# Build Instructions

**Prerequisites:**

Before building or installing the Unity project on your device, ensure the device is in [Developer Mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/#enable-developer-mode). Optionally, set it up with the [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/ts-odh/).

To build NorthStar, set the project to the Android platform via (File -> Build Settings).

At this point, you can either connect the device and build directly to it or create an APK on your computer for later installation. Use "Build and Run" to build directly or "Build" to create an APK. No additional steps in the editor are necessary for building.

To install the APK from your computer to the device, use either ADB or the Meta Developer Hub. Both methods require developer mode to be enabled.
