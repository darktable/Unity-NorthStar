  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Rope System\n\nNorthStar's development prioritized creating
    a realistic rope simulation system. We achieved this by combining Verlet integration
    for simulation with anchoring constraints for interactive rope behavior.\n\n##
    Verlet Simulation\n\n![](./Images/RopeSystem/Fig3.png)\n\nVerlet integration
    simplifies rope physics by focusing on point mass calculations. Each point mass
    stores only its current and previous positions, assuming a unit mass. Constraints
    are enforced by adjusting point positions to maintain the rope's rest length.\n\nThis
    approach simulates how ropes visually react to player interactions. However,
    forces only travel from the player to the rope, not bidirectionally.\n\nTo enhance
    stability, we implemented a binding system. This system allows specific nodes
    in the rope simulation to act as kinematic points, unaffected by forces or constraints.
    We optimized the Verlet simulation using Burst Jobs to support many nodes and
    high iteration counts for constraint solving.\n\n### Relevant Files\n- [BurstRope.cs](https://github.com/meta-quest/Unity-UtilityPackages/blob/main/com.meta.utilities.ropes/Runtime/Rope/VerletRope/BurstRope.cs)\n\n##
    Anchoring Constraints\n\nWe developed an anchoring system to let players interact
    with and be constrained by ropes. This system enables ropes to wrap around static
    objects, dynamically creating bends that constrain the Verlet simulation.\n\n**How
    Anchors Work:**\n\n- When the rope encounters an obstacle, a new anchor is created
    based on normal direction, bend angle, and bend direction.\n- If the player holds
    the rope, the system calculates the rope length between two anchors and applies
    a configurable joint with a linear limit to prevent overstretching.\n- Slack
    and spooled rope are managed, allowing:\n  - Loose rope to be pulled through
    when tightening.\n  - Extra rope to be spooled out, such as for sail controls.\n-
    If the player exerts enough force, the rope can slip, allowing hands to slide
    along it like a real rope.\n- The number of bends, slack amount, and spooled
    rope length can trigger events when the rope is pulled tight or tied.\n\n###

    Tube Rendering\n\n![](./Images/RopeSystem/Fig2.png)\n\nTo render ropes visually,
    we developed a tube renderer that:\n\n- Uses rope nodes to generate a lofted
    mesh along a spline.\n- Supports subdivisions for added detail.\n- Adds indentation
    and twisting for realism.\n- Utilizes normal mapping for enhanced depth and texture.\n-
    Is optimized using Burst Jobs for efficient performance.\n\n### Relevant Files\n-

    Collision Detection\n\n![](./Images/RopeSystem/Fig1.png)\n\nEfficient rope collision
    detection was challenging. We used `Physics.ComputePenetration()` to detect interactions
    between Verlet nodes and nearby level geometry. However, two key issues arose:\n1.
    `ComputePenetration` is incompatible with Jobs or Burst, so collision detection
    had to occur on the main thread after Verlet simulation.\n2. Single collision
    checks per frame caused phasing issues, as ropes passed through objects when
    nodes were forced apart.\n\n**Optimizations for Better Collision Detection:**\n\nTo
    address these issues, we:\n- Split the rope simulation into multiple sub-steps,
    running a collision check after each sub-step.\n- Forced the first job to complete
    immediately, allowing for early collision checks in the frame.\n- Performed the
    second sub-step during the frame, resolving it in `LateUpdate()` for increased
    stability.\n- Used `SphereOverlapCommand` in a Job to efficiently gather potential
    collisions without stalling the main thread.\n\n### Relevant Files\n- [BurstRope.cs](https://github.com/meta-quest/Unity-UtilityPackages/blob/main/com.meta.utilities.ropes/Runtime/Rope/VerletRope/BurstRope.cs)\n\n##
    Editor Workflow\n\n![](./Images/RopeSystem/Fig4.png)\n\nWe streamlined the process
    of adding and configuring ropes in scenes with an intuitive editor workflow:\n-
    Start with the `RopeSystem` prefab.\n- Edit the included spline to define the
    desired rope shape.\n- Use context menu options in the `RopeSystem` component
    to:\n  - Set up nodes.\n  - Define the rope's total length.\n- Run the simulation
    in a test scene and allow the rope to settle naturally.\n- Copy the anchor points
    and `BurstRope` nodes from the simulation back into the editor.\n- Finalize the
    rope setup for use in live gameplay.\n\n![](./Images/RopeSystem/Fig0.png)\n\n###

    Conclusion\n\nBy combining Verlet simulation with dynamic anchoring constraints,
    we created a realistic and performant rope system for NorthStar. The use of Burst
    Jobs, tube rendering, and multi-step collision detection balanced realism, interactivity,
    and performance. The editor workflow streamlined development, enabling efficient
    iteration and fine-tuning of rope behaviors.\n"
