    Unity ensures the full
    viewport, up to the configured maximum shadow distance, is covered in the shadowmap.
    For many games and platforms, this balances texel density with full scene coverage.
    However, in this game, set on a ship''s surface with the Meta Quest''s impressive
    FOV, it''s inefficient to assign shadow coverage to areas like the sky and ocean.
    Shadow Importance Volumes solve this by letting designers specify which surfaces
    need shadowmap coverage, allowing other surfaces to remain outside the shadow
    volume.

    ShadowImportanceVolumes
    require changes to URP to adjust the shadow projection matrix and shadow distance
    before shadow casting.

    ##
    Using Shadow Importance Volumes


    Shadow Importance Volumes activate automatically
    when any enabled volume intersects the camera. To create a new volume, make an
    empty Game Object, select Add Component, and choose ShadowImportanceVolume. Reposition
    and scale the volume as needed. Only the surface that can receive shadows needs
    to be inside a volume, not the entire object or mesh.

    If
    all volumes are disabled or don''t intersect the camera, shadows revert to Unity''s
    default implementation.


    ## How They Work


    First, all volumes in the
    game world intersect with the active camera''s frustum. Any volume or part outside
    the camera frustum is ignored. The intersection of volumes and frustum forms
    a hull for shadowcasting. This hull is transformed into shadow space, and an
    adjustment matrix is generated to fit the shadowmap more tightly around active
    areas.

    Comparison
    of shadowmap between default and with volumes on the ship deck. The very wide
    FOV forces Unity to size the shadowmap inefficiently:
