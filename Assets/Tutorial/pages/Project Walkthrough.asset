  - Header: Task Manager
    Description: "Each gameplay beat is broken up into a series of objects called
      Task Sequences, which act as chapters of the game. Each Task Sequence consists
      of one or more Task Definitions. A sequence is complete when all tasks within
      it are marked as done. The Task Manager handles the progression, starting the
      next sequence upon completion of the previous one.\r"
