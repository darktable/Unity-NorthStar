  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Parameter Overview\n\n- **Albedo:** Represents the general
    color of the water. It functions like albedo in any regular PBR shader but can
    be modified by the foam amount if enabled.\n\n**Foam**\n\n- **Enable Shore Foam:**
    Activates the shore foam effect, creating a foam line where objects intersect
    the water plane. Requires the depth texture.\n- **Foam Texture:** The texture
    used for foam. Only the red channel is used to save bandwidth. A full-color texture
    with an alpha can be used if needed, but minor shader changes are required.\n-
    **Foam Scale:** Determines the world space tiling of the foam. Larger numbers
    make the foam smaller and more detailed but more repetitive.\n- **Foam Scroll:**
    Applies a world space panning effect to the foam for added visual interest. Often
    unnoticeable due to ocean movement, so it may not be necessary.\n- **Foam Color:**
    A color tint applied to the foam texture. Used as a lerp parameter instead of
    a multiply to avoid blue-white foam that can't reach fully white.\n- **Foam Strength:**
    Multiplies the foam texture strength. Higher values produce more foam but may
    reduce soft gradients at edges.\n- **Foam Threshold:** Higher values create foam
    in more areas, while lower values restrict foam to the peaks of high waves.\n-
    **Foam Aeration Color:** Adds detail to foam calculations using additional texture
    channels, but currently disabled for performance reasons.\n- **Foam Aeration
    Threshold:** Controls secondary foam texture details, currently not enabled.\n\n**Scatter**\n\n-
    **Enable Subsurface:** Toggles the effect that produces extra light scattering
    from tall waves. Can be disabled in gentle seas or certain lighting to improve
    performance.\n- **Scattering Color:** The color and intensity applied to the
    effect. Best values depend on the environment and ocean, often blue-green or
    green, as red light is absorbed and blue is scattered.\n- **Forward Scatter:**
    Controls the sharpness of scattering along the light direction. High values give
    a small, bright highlight; smaller values spread the effect for a uniform look.\n-
    **Back Scatter:** Produces extra scattering when looking away from the light
    source. Smaller values like 0.3 work better as back-scattering is usually more
    diffused.\n- **Scatter Blend:** Balances the contribution of forward and back
    scatter. A value of 0.5 provides an equal combination.\n- **Scatter Displacement
    Power:** Affects the strength of the scatter effect based on horizontal displacement.
    Larger displacements provide stronger scattering. A power function varies the
    effect from linear to dramatic.\n- **Scatter Displacement Factor:** A multiplier
    for the scatter amount compared to ocean displacement, combined with the power
    function to control the overall effect.\n\n**Normals**\n\n- **Normal Map:** The
    secondary normal map combined with base ocean normals from the simulation. Any
    normal map can be used, but one baked from the ocean simulation is recommended
    for high quality.\n- **Normal Map Size:** The area the normal map covers in world
    space. Should be smaller than the ocean profile\u2019s patch size to provide
    detail at different scales and reduce tiling.\n- **Normal Map Scroll:** Time-based
    offset applied to the normal map, should align with wind direction but not match
    exactly for interesting interactions.\n- **Normal Map Strength:** Scales the
    strength of the detail normal map.\n- **Normal Rotation:** Rotates the normal
    map UVs.\n\n**Displacement Noise**\n\n- **Noise Scroll:** Scrolls the displacement
    noise texture, similar to normals and foam. Often, minimal or no scrolling is
    sufficient.\n- **Noise Texture:** The noise texture should tile seamlessly and
    contain a mix of light and dark areas to break up ocean simulation repetition
    without reducing displacement.\n- **Noise Strength:** Controls how strongly ocean
    displacement is attenuated by the noise texture. A strength of 0 disables the
    effect.\n- **Noise Scale:** Controls the size of the noise texture in world space.
    Should be larger than the ocean patch size to avoid noticeable repetition.\n\n**Smoothness**\n\n-
    **Smoothness Close:** The smoothness value for the ocean. Previously, a \u201CSmoothness
    Far\u201D slider was used for distance, but this is now baked into mip maps of
    the normal/foam/smoothness texture.\n\n**Shore**\n\n- **Enable Refraction:**
    Activates the underwater refraction effect, requiring the Camera Opaque Texture,
    which has a performance cost.\n- **Refraction Offset:** Controls how much the
    refraction effect is offset based on the normal map.\n- **Shore Foam Strength:**
    Controls the intensity of the shore foam effect.\n- **Shore Foam Threshold:**
    Controls how quickly shore foam fades in at the edge of objects intersecting
    the water.\n- **Shore Foam Fade:** Controls how quickly shore foam fades out
    with distance.\n- **Depth Threshold:** Controls the distance at which an underwater
    object is fully tinted by the depth color.\n- **Depth Color:** The color used
    to tint an underwater object at the \u201Cdepth threshold\u201D value.\n\n**Giant
    Wave**\n\nSettings generally set from C# code but can be used for control or
    debugging:\n\n- **Giant Wave Height:** The peak height of the giant wave.\n-
    **Giant Wave Width:** The length along the wave for effect calculation.\n- **Giant
    Wave Length:** The wavelength of the giant wave, controlling width and speed.\n-
    **Giant Wave Angle:** Controls the angle of wave movement towards the center.\n-
    **Center:** The location the wave moves towards.\n- **Falloff:** Controls the
    slope along the wave sides, fading it in.\n- **Phase:** A debug option showing
    the wave's progress towards the target.\n- **Giant Wave Steepness:** Controls
    the steepness of the Gerstner wave used for the giant wave.\n- **Giant Wave Curve
    Strength:** Controls how strongly the wave peak curves towards its target for
    a dramatic effect.\n- **Giant Wave Enabled:** Toggles the giant wave, saving
    calculations when disabled.\n\n\n### Relevant Files\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/meta-quest/Unity-UtilityPackages/blob/main/com.meta.utilities.environment/Runtime/Shaders/Water/Water%20Realistic.shadergraph\">Water
