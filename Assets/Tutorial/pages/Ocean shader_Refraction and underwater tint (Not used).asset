  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Refraction and Underwater Tint (Not used)\n\nA fake
    refraction effect was included to sample the scene color behind the water surface,
    but due to performance costs from copying the scene texture, it's not used. The
    effect is noticeable in shallow waters like the docks scene, so it was an acceptable
    compromise to maintain performance goals. The effect involves multiplying the
    world space normal XZ components by a small factor to offset a screenspace UV,
    used to sample the scene color texture.\n\nThe depth texture is sampled at this
    location, and the scene color is tinted using a simple exponential fog formula:
    `sceneColor *= exp(-depthDifference * extinction)`. Extinction is calculated
    using the \u201CColor at Distance to Extinction\u201D function, which calculates
    the extinction coefficient for a specific tint color at a specific distance,
    more intuitive than working with an extinction coefficient directly.\n\nThe water
    albedo also needs modification by the inverse of this amount, so shallow water
    areas don't have more scattering/fog than they should due to their shallow depth.\n\n"
