    The tiling normal map is sampled
    using the same UVs as the displacement map. It contains foam and smoothness values
    in the blue/alpha channels, discussed shortly. The normal value includes the
    X and Z components, with the Y component reconstructed using a `NormalReconstructZ`
    function. Since the ocean is a world-space grid, a regular tangent-to-world transform
    isn''t needed; we can swizzle the Y and Z channels.


    A detail normal map
    is sampled with a different scale/offset than the main normal map, usually smaller
    than the primary ocean normal map. The normal maps are combined using partial
    derivative blending, accurately combining different normals from heightmaps.
    This normal map can be scaled, panned, and rotated over time. When panned similarly
    to the ocean, with a slightly offset rotation and speed, it adds convincing detail
    to the lower-resolution ocean simulation.


    When the giant wave is enabled,
    partial derivatives combine with the ocean normal and detail normal partial derivatives
    to produce the final world space normal. The giant wave is re-evaluated in the
    pixel shader to obtain normals, as per-vertex passing often lacked accuracy,
    causing visual artifacts.
