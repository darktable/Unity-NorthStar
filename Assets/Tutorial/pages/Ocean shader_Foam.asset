  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Foam\n\n![](./Images/OceanShader/Fig4.gif)\n\nA value
    for foam coverage is packed into the normal map's blue channel. It's converted
    into a foam mask with a configurable threshold using `saturate(foamStrength *
    (threshold \u2013 normalMap.b))`. This allows foam variation across ocean profiles.
    It's multiplied with a detail foam texture. The result is used to lerp between
    the ocean\u2019s blue albedo color and a configurable foam color. While often
    left white, a slight tint can be used for specific effects.\n\nShore foam functionality
    was implemented by sampling the depth buffer and using the depth difference to
    produce foam along object edges intersecting the water. However, for optimization,
    it's not used, as it depends on the scene depth texture, and copying it can impact
    performance.\n\nThe total foam amount masks out underwater effects like subsurface
    scattering, as heavy foam layers block strong underwater light.\n\n"
