    ## Overview


    In North Star,
    the boat is essential. It must move smoothly, turn, and interact with the ocean
    while allowing free player movement onboard. We explored several methods to achieve
    this.


    ## Movement Approaches


    ### True Movement


    Initially, the
    boat was a kinematic rigid body controlled by scripting, with objects physically
    on it. This caused hand tracking and physics issues, so we abandoned this method.


    ###
    Move the World


    We considered moving the environment around the boat instead
    of the boat itself. However, this complicated persistent objects outside the
    boat, so we did not pursue it.


    ### Fake Movement


    We adopted a "fake
    movement" system. The boat''s visual position updates before rendering and resets
    afterward. This prevents physics issues, avoids dragging objects with the boat,
    and eliminates the need to move the world (ocean, islands, sky, reflections,
    etc.). We developed helper functions for transforming between world space and
    "boat space."

    ##
    Rocking and Bobbing


    To simulate ocean movement, we implemented a procedural
    noise system to make the boat rock and bob. The effect scales with boat speed,
    influenced by wind direction and sail angle. We tested a more realistic wave-height
    and momentum-based system but replaced it for better player comfort and direct
    control.


    ## Reaction Movement


    We scripted specific boat movements
    for special events, like waves hitting the boat or creature attacks, using the
    timeline.

    ##
    Comfort Settings


    To ensure player comfort, procedural motion is directly
    controlled, allowing magnitude adjustments. A comfort option locks the horizon
    angle, keeping the player upright as if they had perfect "sea legs." This stabilizes
    the horizon and prevents motion sickness.


    ```cs

    var boatRotation =
    BoatController.Instance.MovementSource.CurrentRotation;

    CameraRig.rotation
    = Quaternion.Slerp(Quaternion.identity, Quaternion.Inverse(boatRotation), GlobalSettings.PlayerSettings.ReorientStrength)
    * CameraRig.parent.localRotation;

    ```
