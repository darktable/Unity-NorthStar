    **Prerequisites:**


    Before
    building or installing the Unity project on your device, ensure the device is
    in [Developer Mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/#enable-developer-mode).
    Optionally, set it up with the [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/ts-odh/).


    To
    build NorthStar, set the project to the Android platform via (File -> Build Settings).

    At
    this point, you can either connect the device and build directly to it or create
    an APK on your computer for later installation. Use "Build and Run" to build
    directly or "Build" to create an APK. No additional steps in the editor are necessary
    for building.

    To install the APK from
    your computer to the device, use either ADB or the Meta Developer Hub. Both methods
    require developer mode to be enabled.
