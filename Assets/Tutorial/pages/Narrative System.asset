  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Narrative Sequencing\n\n## Introduction\n\nNorthStar\u2019s
    Narrative Sequencing System is a custom, lightweight framework for efficiently
    scripting game events. It primarily supports linear structures but also accommodates
    branching narratives and multiple task options.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe system
    uses Task Sequences, which function as game chapters. Each Task Sequence includes
    one or more Task Definitions. A sequence completes when all its tasks are marked
    as done. The Task Manager oversees progression, starting the next sequence once
    the previous one finishes.\n\nTask sequences are managed via the **Task Manager
    object**: ..Assets/Resources/NarrativeSequence/Task Manager.asset\n\n## Tasks\n\nNorthStar
    typically assigns a new Task Sequence to each teleport point, with actions at
    that location divided into Task Definitions.\n\nFor example, in the B2_S4 Task
    Sequence, where the player helps Audrey and Bessie move barrels, tasks trigger
    sequentially based on prerequisites. However, multiple tasks can be active simultaneously,
    allowing player-driven events.\n\n**Task Handler Component**\n\nA Task Handler
    must be present in the scene for each potential active task. It includes the
    following properties:\n- **Task ID** \u2013 Manages the specific task.\n- **Player
    Transform** \u2013 Tracks player position (typically PlayerV2).\n- **Player Gaze
    Camera** \u2013 Used for look direction checks.\n- **Complete When** \u2013 Determines
    if the task completes when all or any conditions are met.\n\n**Completion Conditions**\n\nA
    task completes when at least one condition is met. If no condition is set, it
    completes instantly. Conditions include:\n- **Hit Targets** \u2013 Requires hitting
    listed harpoon targets (e.g., Kraken fight).\n- **Reeled Targets** \u2013 Used
    for retrieving harpoon-hooked objects.\n- **Wait for Event Broadcast** \u2013
    Triggers upon receiving a specified event.\n- **Rope Is Spooled** \u2013 Checks
    rope length between Min/Max values.\n- **Rope Is Tied** \u2013 Completes when
    rope is secured.\n- **Proximity** \u2013 Player reaches a set distance from the
    target.\n- **Look at Target** \u2013 Player faces the target within a set angle.\n-
    **Time Delay** \u2013 Completes after a specified duration.\n- **Wait for Event**
    \u2013 Triggered by a Unity Event on a referenced object.\n- **Wait for Animation**
    \u2013 Completes when an animation finishes.\n- **Wait for Playable** \u2013
    Completes when a timeline ends.\n\n**Event Triggers**\n\nTasks can trigger events
    at different stages:\n- **On Task Started** \u2013 Fires when the task begins.\n-
    **On Task Completed** \u2013 Fires upon completion.\n- **On Reminder** \u2013
    Fires at intervals while active.\n\n**Reminder Interval:** If set, triggers On
    Reminder actions every X seconds. (Set to 0 to disable.)\n\n**Scripted Narrative
    Sequences**\n\nMost narrative events in NorthStar are driven by Timelines using
    Playable Directors and Timeline Signals. Each Task Manager typically has:\n-
    **Playable Director** \u2013 Plays Timeline assets.\n- **Dialogue Player** \u2013
    Controls voice-over sequences.\n\nWhen a task starts, its Dialogue Player begins
    playback, triggering the Playable Director. Even non-dialogue sequences follow
    this structure for consistency.\n\n**Best Practice:** Set Playable Director Update
    Method to DSP Clock to prevent audio desynchronization.\n\n## Creating New Tasks\n\n**To
    add a new Task Sequence:**\n1. Duplicate an existing sequence (..Assets/NorthStar/Data/Task
    Sequences) or create one via Create > Data > Narrative Sequencing > Task Sequence.\n2.
    Add Task Definitions inside the sequence.\n3. Register the sequence in the Task
    Manager:\n   - Open the Task Manager object.\n   - Add the new Task Sequence
    to the Sequences list (in order).\n   - Refresh the Task Manager from the context
    menu.\n\n**Setting Task Prerequisites**\n- Use the dropdown menu to set a prerequisite
    or click Add Preceding Task ID for automatic ordering.\n- Leave at least one
    task with no prerequisite to prevent game progression from stalling.\n- If you
    see an Undefined ID error, ensure the Task Sequence is registered in the Task
    Manager.\n\n**Adding Tasks to a Scene**\n1. Place a GameObject with a Task Handler
    component.\n2. Assign the Task ID and required settings.\n3. Ensure a Game Flow
    Controller is in the scene (see Game Flow prefab).\n4. If using multi-scene sequences,
    set the First Task to the earliest sequence in that scene.\n\n**Testing & Debugging**\n\nFor
    quick narrative testing:\n- **Before Play Mode**: Set First Task to the desired
    sequence.\n- **During Play Mode**: Select a Task Handler and click \"Start narrative
    from this sequence\" to skip forward.\n\n**Note:** Some sequences rely on prior
    events. Skipping ahead may cause characters/objects to remain incorrectly active
    or disabled.\n"
