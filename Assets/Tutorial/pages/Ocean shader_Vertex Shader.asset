    The ocean shader starts by sampling
    the displacement map in the vertex shader. UVs are calculated from the world
    position of the vertices, divided by the ocean''s total scale.


    A Displacement
    Noise texture is sampled with a scale independent of the ocean''s scale. This
    noise controls the displacement strength, varying the effect across the ocean''s
    surface to reduce noticeable tiling. Choosing the right noise texture and scale
    is crucial to avoid excessive displacement reduction across the ocean.


    The
    horizontal displacement length, multiplied by the displacement noise strength,
    is passed to the fragment shader for fake subsurface scattering.


    Additionally,
    a "Giant Wave" feature is used in some cutscenes to create a large wave moving
    towards the boat. It uses a single Gerstner wave with a masking function to limit
    the effect to one wave of a specified width. Due to time constraints, this was
    implemented in HLSL via a custom function node instead of Shadergraph. The wave
    gradually rises from the ocean and quickly fades after hitting the boat. Parameters
    from C# code ensure the wave always moves towards the boat. The output is an
    additional displacement and partial derivatives, combined with existing ocean
    displacement/normals.

    The giant
    wave includes fudge factors to align and hit the ship, then fade. However, achieving
    this in all situations was challenging, so some parameters are controlled through
    Timeline curves for extra control. Some equations could be improved to reduce
    manual tweaking.
