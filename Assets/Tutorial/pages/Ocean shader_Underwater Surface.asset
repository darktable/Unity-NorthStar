  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Underwater Surface\n\n![](./Images/OceanShader/Fig3.png)\n\nIn
    the game's final part, where the player is underwater, a duplicate water shader
    is used with double-sided rendering enabled and extra logic for the water's backfaces.
    A custom fog function tints the underwater surface as it gets further from the
    player.\n\nAdditionally, the environment reflection lookup is modified to use
    a refracted direction instead of reflected. This produces the \u201CSnell's window\u201D
    effect observed when looking up at an underwater surface, where parts of the
    sky are visible in a circle above the viewer. Using the existing environment
    cubemap means this doesn't require a scene texture copy, so the performance overhead
    is minimal, as it replaces the sky reflection lookup in a regular PBR shader.
    The downside is that above-water objects like the ship aren't visible, but a
    similar effect could be achieved with alpha blending if desired.\n\n"
