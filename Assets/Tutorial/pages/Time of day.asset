    Time of Day System in NorthStar is managed by an environment profile, centralizing
    settings for efficient scene management and real-time adjustments. It supports
    real-time previews and transitions, even in scene mode, for faster iteration
    and development.\n\nSmooth transitions are achieved by lerping between floats,
    vectors, and colors. Precomputed values minimize GPU overhead. The system directly
    controls environment parameters, avoiding costly techniques like full atmospheric
    scattering and complex cloud lighting.\n\n## Environment System\n\n![](./Images/TimeOfDay/Fig1.png)\n\nThe
    Environment System is the core of the Time of Day System. It:\n- Manages scene
    object references.\n- Stores global and default values.\n- Handles transitions
    between environment profiles.\n- Integrates rendering logic with the current
    render pipeline via RenderPipelineManager callbacks.\n\n**Custom Rendering Logic**\n\nThis
    system manages key rendering tasks, including:\n- Updating ocean simulations.\n-
    Rendering the ocean quadtree.\n- Rendering the sun and moon discs.\n- Setting
    global shader properties.\n\n## Skybox Updater\n\nThe Skybox Updater manages
    environmental lighting by adjusting:\n- Skybox reflection probes.\n- Ambient
    lighting.\n- Fog settings.\n- Directional light angles and colors.\n\nThese updates
    ensure accurate lighting and atmospheric transitions throughout the day.\n\n##
    Sun Disk Renderer\n\nThe Sun Disk Renderer renders the sun and moon as simple
    quads with a custom shader, rather than embedding logic within the skybox shader.\n\n**Key
    Features:**\n- Basic color and texture functionality.\n- Simulates distant light
    source illumination (e.g., moon shading using a normal map).\n- Cloud, fog, and
    atmospheric occlusion, ensuring natural integration with skybox colors.\n\nThese
    materials inherit from the base skybox materials, maintaining proper cloud occlusion
    and sky color blending.\n\n# Environment Profiles\n\nThe Time of Day System uses
    scriptable objects to define environment profiles. Each profile contains nested
    classes grouping relevant settings. Below is an overview of the main configurable
    elements:\n\n![](./Images/TimeOfDay/Fig2.png)\n\n**Post Process Profile**\n\n-
    Allows custom post-processing settings per environment.\n- Supports smooth transitions
    between profiles.\n- Uses a default profile if none is assigned.\n\n**Ocean Settings**\n\n-
    Defines the current ocean state.\n- Uses a specific ocean material with the Ocean
    Shader (refer to the Ocean System documentation for details).\n\n**Skybox Material**\n\n-
    Defines the skybox shader used to render the sky.\n\n## Sun and Celestial Object
    Settings\n\n**Sun Settings**\n\n- Intensity \u2013 Controls directional light
    strength.\n- Filter \u2013 Adjusts directional light color.\n- Rotation \u2013
    Controls sun orientation (X and Y components have a noticeable effect).\n- Sun
    Disk Material \u2013 Must use a skybox shader with Is Celestial Object enabled.\n-
    Angular Diameter \u2013 Controls the sun's apparent size (real-world value ~0.52,
    but adjustable for visuals).\n\n**Moon/Secondary Celestial Object**\n\n- Render
    Secondary Celestial Object \u2013 Enables rendering of a secondary disk (e.g.,
    the moon).\n- Secondary Object Rotation \u2013 Similar to the sun, but controls
    the secondary celestial body's orientation.\n- Secondary Object Material \u2013
    Configured similarly to the sun.\n- Angular Diameter \u2013 Adjusts the moon\u2019s
    apparent size (real-world value ~0.5 degrees, but tweakable for aesthetics).\n\n##
    Fog and Wind Settings\n\n**Fog Settings**\n\n- Fog Color \u2013 Defines the full-density
    fog color.\n- Density \u2013 Controls fog thickness via an exponential density
    function.\n- Underwater Fog Color \u2013 Specific to underwater environments
    (used in Beat 7).\n- Underwater Tint & Distance \u2013 Controls underwater color
    blending and fade distance.\n\n**Wind Settings**\n\n- Wind Yaw (Horizontal Angle)
    \u2013 Affects ocean movement and sail interactions.\n- Wind Pitch (Vertical
    Angle) \u2013 Influences sail behavior and ocean wind speed calculations.\n\n##
    Gradient Ambient & Precomputed Lighting\n\n**Gradient Ambient Settings**\n\n-
    Used with the Environment System to apply ambient lighting based on a gradient
    rather than the skybox.\n\n**Environment Data Optimization**\n\n- Stores precomputed
    ambient lighting from the skybox to reduce runtime calculations, optimizing performance.\n\n##
    Conclusion\n\nThe Time of Day System in NorthStar is a highly optimized tool
    for dynamic environment control in mobile VR. By focusing on direct parameter
    manipulation, precomputed values, and scriptable environment profiles, it achieves
    realistic time-based transitions while minimizing GPU load.\n\nThis structured
    approach ensures high customization, allowing seamless environmental shifts and
    efficient real-time iteration during development.\n\n### Relevant Files\n- [EnvironmentSystem.cs](https://github.com/meta-quest/Unity-UtilityPackages/tree/main/com.meta.utilities.environment/Runtime/Scripts/Environment/EnvironmentSystem.cs)\n-
